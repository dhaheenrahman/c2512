            train_name: express train, number_of_tickets: 3, 
            seat_numbers: [S1, S2, S3] each seat price is Rs.120.
            food ordered: [samosa @ Rs.60 x 2, pop corn @ Rs.100 x 3, coffee @ Rs.40 x 1, pups @ Rs.50 x 3]
        And

            food ordered: [samosa @ Rs.60 x 2, pop corn @ Rs.100 x 3, coffee @ Rs.40 x 1, pups @ Rs.50 x 3]

Now, I need the tables script in oracle with primary key, not null, and foreign keys.
And I need insert statements for the tables. 
And I need the data in tabular form for all NF tables.
