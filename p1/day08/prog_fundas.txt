1. To find average of two numbers:

pseudofunction:

function findAverage(number1 -> int, number2 -> int) -> float
    float average = (number1 + number2) / 2
    return float

function findAvgTest()
    input number1, number2
    float result = findAverage(numebr1, number2)
    print result

pseudocode:

findAverageTest()

--- cpp ---

#include<iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

float findAverage(int number1,int number2){
    float average = (float)(number1 + number2) / 2;
    return average;
}

void findAverageTest(void){
    int number1, number2;
    cout << "Enter number 1: ";
    cin >> number1;
    cout << "Enter number 2: ";
    cin >> number2;
    cout << findAverage(number1, number2);
}

int main(void){
    findAverageTest();
}
